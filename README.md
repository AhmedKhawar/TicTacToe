Tic Tac Toe Game
A classic console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C++ for two players. The game is straightforward, allowing players to mark a position on a 3x3 grid by entering row and column numbers. A win is achieved by marking three consecutive cells in a row, column, or diagonal.

Features
Multiplayer: This game is designed for two players, who take turns marking cells.
Console-Based: A simple interface that runs in the console.
Input Validation: Ensures players only choose empty cells within valid row and column ranges.
Game Statistics: Tracks game rounds and outputs results to a stats.txt file, recording wins and draws.
Game Rules
Players take turns entering row and column numbers (0-2) to mark their positions.
The objective is to align three identical marks (either 'X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal.
If all nine cells are filled without a winning alignment, the game is a draw.
Game Controls
Input Format: Players enter two numbers (row and column) to choose a cell.
